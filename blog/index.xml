&lt;!-- /BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I was still working on my thesis. Putting together everything I did over the past six years brought me back to those days in graduate school. It reminded me of the ups and downs along the way, and of course the six freezing winters I spent in Minnesotaâ€¦It was definitely not an easy six year in my life but I was grateful that I had such an experience. I appreciated all the challenges I had to take, all the cool things I learned, and all the wonderful people I met. These are things that made me stronger and they prepared me for my new adventure - data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About four months ago, I started to learn data science from MOOCs, books, and some wonderful blogs. It has been a mixture of fun and challenges (and a lot of screen time!). With this site, I hope to gear my learning process towards hands-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, something fun to share - a word cloud of my thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
