Hello, and welcome to my site. My name is Yanfei Wu. I obtained my PhD degree in Materials Science and Engineering from University of Minnesota. My PhD research focused on investigating the structure and properties of novel organic electronic materials. By analyzing a large amount of data collected with a number of advanced characterization techniques, I was able to generate some insights into the fundamental structure-property correlations to help solve the challenging problems in materials application.   

Fascinated by how data-driven analytics applications are transforming our world, I decided to pivot into Data Science. Through persistent self-education (taking a lot of [MOOCs](https://yanfei-wu.github.io/course/) and working on [personal projects](https://yanfei-wu.github.io/project/)), I have acquired diverse skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. I've also started to branch out to learn more about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The more I learn, the more curious I get. I find myself sincerely enjoy **becoming** a data scientist. I think this is one of the things that really attract me about this field: the opportunity to learn something new every day.
