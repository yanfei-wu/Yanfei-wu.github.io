      <description>&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliquam tincidunt mauris eu risus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn&amp;rsquo;t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;header-level-2&#34;&gt;Header Level 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Toxic Beauty&#34;: Chemicals in Cosmetics</title>

&lt;p&gt;How many different beauty products do you apply onto your face and body everyday? How many chemical ingredients do they contain? And how many of those chemicals have potential health risks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit that I have been a little careless when it comes to the safety of my cosmetic products. Then one day I came across this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/chemicals-cosmetics&#34;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; from California Safe Cosmetics Program in California Department of Public Health. It appears that companies (manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label) must submit a list of all products that contain any ingredients &lt;strong&gt;known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm&lt;/strong&gt; if the company has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. So I started to dig into this dataset because I was very curious about what exactly were reported. Let me walk you through what I did. All codes are available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yanfei-wu/chemical_cosmetic&#34;&gt;my Github Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-cleaning&#34;&gt;Data Cleaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;missing-data&#34;&gt;Missing Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset has 80,004 rows and 22 columns. We can visualize columns containing missing data using a heatmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/missingdata.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the majority of the rows in the &lt;code&gt;&#39;DiscontinuedDate&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;ChemicalDateRemoved&#39;&lt;/code&gt; columns are missing. &lt;code&gt;&#39;CSFId&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;CSF&#39;&lt;/code&gt; also contains a lot of missing data, followed by &lt;code&gt;&#39;CASNumber&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;. We know that typical ways of dealing with missing data include a. deleting rows/columns with missing values and b. filling the missing values with some value. The first approach is the easist but caution needs to be taken because we can potentially lose some important information. In our case, the &lt;code&gt;&#39;DiscontinuedDate&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;ChemicalDateRemoved&#39;&lt;/code&gt; columns give information about product discontinuation or reformulation. So here they are probably just not applicable (products still on sale and no reformulation has been done). We can leave them as they are. For the missing &lt;code&gt;&#39;CSFId&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#39;CSF&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;CasId&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, I do not have enough knowledge to fill in these values but I do not want to lose records by deleting corresponding rows. So again, let&amp;rsquo;s leave them as they are. &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; is actually something interesting. We can try to fill in the missing values using information given in the dataset, e.g., &lt;code&gt;&#39;CompanyName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/missingdata_company.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These products with a missing &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; actually come from 6 companies and two of them are cosmetic companies. Based on a quick googling, they each carries one brand only (brand name is the same as the company name). So we can simply fill in the brand names for products from these two companies. In the remaining companies, two of them (Fisk Industries Inc. and Atlas Development Limited) only have a small number of records. So it is reasonable to look at them individually and fill in the missing brand names based on the brands they carry. For the remaining records, they can actually be filled with &amp;ldquo;Unknown&amp;rdquo; for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;duplicates-and-unique-values&#34;&gt;Duplicates and Unique Values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem a public dataset might have is duplicates. Note that before checking duplicates, the inconsistent format of string values (upper and lower cases are mixed) is corrected. 251 duplicated rows are found. Further inspection of these rows does not show any connection or anything in common. So they are simply dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique number of values for several columns are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;CDPHId&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 26,036&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;CompanyName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 508&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 1,820&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;ProductName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 23,992&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;PrimaryCategory&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;SubCategory&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lsquo;: 89&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;ChemicalName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;: 110&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further inspection of the dataset shows that &lt;code&gt;&#39;CDPHId&#39;&lt;/code&gt; represents unique product. So the difference between number of &lt;code&gt;&#39;ProductName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;CDPHId&#39;&lt;/code&gt; indicates that there are products with the same name. We can actually generate a seperate dataframe storing the basic information (&lt;code&gt;&#39;CDPHId&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#39;CompanyName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#39;ProductName&#39;&lt;/code&gt;) of unique products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization&#34;&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several questions I am interested in. For example:&lt;br /&gt;
1. What are the most common reportable chemicals?&lt;br /&gt;
2. Which products have the largest number of reportable chemicals?&lt;br /&gt;
3. Which categories of products are reported most frequently?&lt;br /&gt;
4. Which companies/brands have the largest number of products reported?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;most-common-reportable-chemicals&#34;&gt;Most common reportable chemicals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset is grouped by &lt;code&gt;&#39;ChemicalName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and the number of unique &lt;code&gt;&#39;CDPHId&#39;&lt;/code&gt; is counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/most_common_chemical.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like titanium dioxide is contained in the majority of the products reported. The exact harm of titanium dioxide is not well understood. It is generally considered to be a relatively inert, safe material, but when it is in the form of nanoparticles, some believe that it can penetrate the skin and cause potential health risk. Currently, only airborne, unbound titanium dioxide particle of respirable size is officially listed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/about-proposition-65&#34;&gt;California Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other chemicals are contained in much smaller number of products. The health risks for some of them are also controversial. FDA actually only takes legal action against cosmetic companies if there is enough evidence of a safety problem for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;products-with-the-largest-number-of-reportable-chemicals&#34;&gt;Products with the largest number of reportable chemicals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some statistics about the number of reportable chemicals in the products:&lt;br /&gt;
- Minimum number of reportable chemicals in any product: 1&lt;br /&gt;
- Maximum number of reportable chemicals in any product: 10&lt;br /&gt;
- Median number of reportable chemicals in all product: 1.0&lt;br /&gt;
- Mean number of reportable chemicals in all product: 1.0970579198033492&lt;br /&gt;
- Standard deviation of the number of reportable chemicals in all product: 0.3771734727730194&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the majority of products in the dataset only contains one reportable chemical (highly likely to be titanium dioxide), but there are also products contain more than one reportable chemicals. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/top_product.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of them are hair and skin care products!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;categories-of-products-reported-most-frequently&#34;&gt;Categories of products reported most frequently&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can group the dataset by &lt;code&gt;&#39;PrimaryCategory&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and count the number of unique products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/category.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makeup products is No. 1. This is not surprising because most of them contain chemicals like titanium dioxide, mica, talc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;companies-brands-with-the-largest-number-of-products-reported&#34;&gt;Companies/Brands with the largest number of products reported&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to look at is which companies/brands have the largest number of products reported. Again, simply group the data by &lt;code&gt;&#39;CompanyName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&#39;BrandName&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and count the number of unique products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/company.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../chemicals_file/brand.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The potential risks of a lot of the chemicals are actually controversial and FDA does not take legal action against cosmetic companies unless there is enough evidence. So it is really up to us to decide whether we want to avoid some ingredients or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to products with only one chemical reported like titanium dioxide (commonly used in sunscreens and makeups; probably hard to avoid), we should probably be more cautious about products containing several different kinds of potentially dangerous chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the dataset, makeup is the No.1 category with the most products reported to have potentially dangerous chemicals and baby products seem to be the &amp;ldquo;safest&amp;rdquo;. The former is not surprising to most of us and the latter is reassuring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: the dataset maynot include all products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants due to companies failing to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sentiment Analysis: First Presidential Debate 2016</title>
      <link>https://yanfei-wu.github.io/blog/2016-09-30_debate/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The US presidential election of 2016 is in less than 2 months. After series of presidential primary elections and caucuses, businessman Donald Trump became the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s presidential nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton became the Democratic Party&amp;rsquo;s presidential nominee. Before November, there are three presidential debates between Clinton and Trump. The first debate just took place several days ago on September 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I show some results of the sentiment analysis I did using tweets collected after the first debate. All codes for this post can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yanfei-wu/presidential_debate/tree/master/first_debate&#34;&gt;my Github Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-data-from-twitter&#34;&gt;Getting Data From Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20,000 tweets were queried using the two candidates&amp;rsquo; names (10,000 tweets for each candidate) from Twitter. The &lt;code&gt;twitteR&lt;/code&gt; package was used and a brief user guide can be find &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/README.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. An additional filtering step was carried out to remove tweets containing both names just to simplify the assignment of the sentiment scores to each candidate. (7179 tweets were left only mentioning Clinton&amp;rsquo;s name and 8854 tweets only mentioning Trump&amp;rsquo;s name.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sentiment-analysis&#34;&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentiment scores were calculated using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/kdd04-revSummary.pdf&#34;&gt;lexicon-based method&lt;/a&gt; as proposed by Hu and Liu. A list of English positive and negative opinion words or sentiment words compiled by them were used (you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The different between the number of positive words and the number of negative words in each tweet was used to determine the option orientation or the sentiment score of each tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Before calculating the sentiment scores, the tweets were cleaned by removing punctuations, special characters (@ and #), and URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the distribution of sentiment scores for each candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/histogram-1.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/boxplot-1.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both candidates have similar variance in terms of their sentiment score distributions with a similar median roughly around 0. And both have outliers or extreme scores (positive and negative). Overall, it is interesting that based on these tweets &lt;strong&gt;people seem to be less happy with Clinton than with Trump&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw sentiment scores were then used to divide the sentiment into 3 categories below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive(1): &lt;code&gt;sentiment score &amp;gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutral(0): &lt;code&gt;-2 &amp;lt; sentiment score &amp;lt; 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative(-1): &lt;code&gt;sentiment score &amp;lt;= -2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distributions of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments for each candidate are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/barplot.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the majority (about 80%) of tweets are neutral towards both candidates but there are indeed bias! &lt;strong&gt;More tweets are negative about Clinton than those that are positive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;word-frequency-analysis&#34;&gt;Word Frequency Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing we can do with tweets is to a word frequency analysis. The first step is to construct corpus by compiling the tweets. Then, the texts in the corpus are broken into tokens, i.e., single word. After tokenization, document-term matrix is created to describe the frequency of each word that occurs in the corpus. Note that some words are removed from this analysis such as the candidates&amp;rsquo; names and English stopwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frequency plots are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/word.frequency.plot-1.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/word.cloud.clinton-1.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../debate_file/word.cloud.trump-1.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;
Not surprisingly, words like &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Emails&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;FBI&amp;rdquo; appear in tweets about Clinton quite frequently. It also looks like a lot of tweets about Clinton also mention Gary Johnson. In tweets about Trump, some frequent words are &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Obama&amp;rdquo;, and also words like &amp;ldquo;unfit&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-final-note&#34;&gt;A Final Note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis shown here is just a sneak peek of the sentiment towards the two candidates. A more thorough analysis could be done with more data (more tweets or incorporating data from other sources), or more complex sentiment metrics. It would also be interesting to dig into those biased data (positive or negative sentiment).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World!</title>
      <link>https://yanfei-wu.github.io/blog/2016-08-26_hello/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I was still working on my thesis. Putting together everything I did over the past six years brought me back to those days in graduate school. It reminded me of the ups and downs along the way, and of course the six freezing winters I spent in Minnesota&amp;hellip;It was definitely not an easy six year in my life but I was grateful that I had such an experience. I appreciated all the challenges I had to take, all the cool things I learned, and all the wonderful people I met. These are things that made me stronger and they prepared me for my new adventure - data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About four months ago, I started to learn data science from MOOCs, books, and some wonderful blogs. It has been a mixture of fun and challenges (and a lot of screen time!). With this site, I hope to gear my learning process towards hands-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, something fun to share - a word cloud of my thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../hello_file/thesis_wordcloud.png&#34; class=&#34;img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
